# LeetCode-Python Practice üêç

This is my personal practice repo for solving LeetCode problems using Python. It's an evolving workspace to experiment, make mistakes, refactor, and track my progress through real coding challenges.

## üóÇ Folder Structure

Problems are loosely organized by the dominant technique or data structure involved. Some folders group related problem-solving patterns together:

### `arrays_strings/`

- Two pointers
- Sliding window
- Prefix sums
- String manipulation

### `hashing/`

- Dictionaries
- Counters
- Hash maps
- Frequency maps

### `linkedlists/`

- Fast and slow pointer
- Merge/split techniques

### `stacks_queues/`

- Stack-based problems
- Queue operations
- Monotonic stacks/queues

### `trees/`

- DFS and BFS
- Matrix traversal
- Graph-like tree problems
- Tree recursion

## üß† Why this exists

- Keep track of what I've solved and how I approached it
- Iterate on patterns like two-pointer, DFS, heap usage, etc.
- Quickly revisit problems when learning new optimizations
- Practice writing clear and testable Python code

This repo is intentionally messy ‚Äî it's meant to reflect learning in progress.

If you're doing something similar, feel free to fork it or use the folder structure as a starting point.
